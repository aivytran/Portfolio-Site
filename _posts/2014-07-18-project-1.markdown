short-description: A combination of Yelp and Google Map to plan bar crawl route. Perfect for a night out!
description: BarCrawler uses Ruby on Rails on the backend with PostgreSQL database and ReactJS with Redux architectural framework on the frontend. <br/><br/> Users can search for bars in specific locations and view individual bars with reviews, hours, and ratings. The map is interactive. When users adjust the map to a new location, a new set of bars will be rendered. Users can select bars and a walking route between the bars will be generated. The route will display the distance and duration between the bars. Users can edit and save the route. BarCrawler is designed to be user-friendly. Users have choices to use the side column to view bars or toggle off the side column and use the map itself to search for and view bars. When users hover over a bar on the side column, its matching marker on the map will bounce. It helps users easily navigate the bars. All data in BarCrawler is fetched from Yelp and Google APIs so they are reliable and up-to-date. <br/><br/>Now what are you waiting for? Check it out and make plans for this weekend!
