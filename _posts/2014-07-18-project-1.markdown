short-description: A combination of Yelp and Google Map to plan bar crawl. Perfect for a night out!
description: BarCrawler uses Ruby on Rails on backend with PostgreSQL database and ReactJS with Redux architectural framework on the frontend. <br/><br/> Users can search for bars in specific location and view individual bar with reviews, hours, and ratings. The map is interactive; when dragged to new location, it renders a new set of bars. Users get to choose bars they like and map walking route between the bars. The route then shows distance and duration and can be edited and saved. The app is designed to be user friendly. Users have choices to use the side column to view bars and see the matching bar's marker on map bouncing or toggle off the side column and use the map itself to search and view bars. All data in BarCrawler is fetched from Yelp and Google APIs so they are reliable and up to date. <br/><br/>And now what are you waiting for? Check it out and make plan for this weekend!
