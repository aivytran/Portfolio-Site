short-description: A interactive chatbot that gives gift suggestions and reminds you to send gifts to your special ones. Save you the headache of choosing gifts!
description: Owlie is built using Wit.ai, a Natural Language Processor that uses machine learning to process user's message into actionable data, Facebook Messenger API to render response, and Express.JS to connect all the technology together. <br/><br/> Owlie is a gift expert who can give gift suggestions based on preferences. Gift suggestions are shown via a horizontal scrollable carousel, each composed of a short description, price, shipping information, and a purchase button. Users can then choose to purchase a gift or request for more suggestions. Not only a gift expert, Owlie is also good at reminding you to buy gift for special events. Users have an option to set reminders, and Owlie will send them a personalized notification messages. Throughout the chat, there are quick replies, a persistent menu, and option templates to help users navigate. <br/><br/> Owlie is still an ongoing experience. For now, Owlie can only understand text messages, but she is learning to understand voice commands. So look forward to the voice control version!  <br/><br/> Check Owlie out and maybe she can help you make your special ones happy! ;)
